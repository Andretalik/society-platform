Society

## Project Overview
This app is meant to create customized pages for the respective societies.
It is a WIP but the end-goal is something that can be used for all societal activities.
It has a news feed that will be showcasing the activities of the societies in descending order of how recent the activities happened.
It will have data management as well to monitor and effectively rank the societies according to their points.
This project is looking to be the replacement to the Society Slack Channel.
